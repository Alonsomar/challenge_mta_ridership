### Comprehensive Summary of the MTA Ridership Dataset

#### General Overview:
The dataset provides systemwide daily ridership and traffic estimates across various transportation modes operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). It includes comparisons against pre-pandemic ridership baselines to measure recovery or trends.

#### Covered Transportation Modes:
1. **Subways** (including Staten Island Railway)
2. **Buses**
3. **Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)**
4. **Metro-North Railroad**
5. **Access-A-Ride (AAR) Paratransit Service**
6. **Bridges and Tunnels**

#### Temporal Coverage:
- Data starts from **March 1, 2020** for most modes.
- For LIRR and Metro-North, data begins **April 1, 2020**.

#### Data Columns and Characteristics (From Data Dictionary):
The dataset includes the following fields:

1. **Date**:
   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Type: Date
   - Represents the date for which ridership or traffic data is reported.

2. **Mode of Transportation**:
   - Type: Categorical
   - Values: `Subway`, `Bus`, `LIRR`, `Metro-North`, `AAR`, `Bridges and Tunnels`.
   - Indicates the specific transportation mode covered in each record.

3. **Daily Ridership/Traffic Volume**:
   - Type: Integer
   - Represents the estimated count of riders or vehicles.

4. **Percentage of Pre-Pandemic Baseline**:
   - Type: Float (percentage values)
   - Calculated using the 2019 non-holiday weekday, Saturday, or Sunday/holiday averages for the same period.

5. **Data Source/Collection Method**:
   - Type: Text
   - Describes the methodology, e.g., MetroCard/OMNY swipes for subways and buses, ticket sales models for railroads, scheduled trips for AAR, and toll collection data for bridges and tunnels.

6. **Estimation Notes**:
   - Type: Text
   - Additional metadata or notes about data quality and reconciliation processes.

#### Data Collection Methodology:
- **Subways and Buses**: Data derived from MetroCard and OMNY swipes/taps, complemented by model-based estimates for certain periods.
- **Railroads (LIRR and Metro-North)**: Estimated using ticket sales across various ticket types.
- **Access-A-Ride**: Based on scheduled trips as an indicator of demand.
- **Bridges and Tunnels**: Traffic volume collected through toll systems.

#### Statistical and Analytic Considerations:
- Figures may be subject to revisions due to reconciliation processes.
- Pre-pandemic comparison methodology was updated in February 2023 to use 2019 averages for accurate baseline calculation.

#### Limitations:
- Data presented here may differ slightly from official totals published elsewhere by the MTA.
- Currently, there are no usage restrictions for the data.

#### Notes for Further Use:
- This dataset can be used to analyze transit recovery trends post-pandemic, assess ridership across different modes, and perform temporal comparisons.
- Ensure to align any comparative analysis with the revised methodology (2023) for consistency.

This dataset provides a granular view of public transit ridership trends in New York, useful for planning, research, or operational optimization.
